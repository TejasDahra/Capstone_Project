# Capstone_Project
The Capstone Project on Late Delivery Delay Risk using Machine Learning aims to build a predictive model that can estimate the probability of delay in product delivery. The project utilizes historical data on product delivery times and factors that can potentially cause delays to train and test a machine learning model. The predictive model can help businesses and logistics companies to proactively identify and mitigate the risk of late delivery, improving customer satisfaction and reducing associated costs. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and selection, as well as the implementation and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms. The final model can be deployed in a production environment to provide real-time predictions for optimizing delivery operations.
